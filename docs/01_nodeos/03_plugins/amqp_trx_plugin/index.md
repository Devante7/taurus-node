## Overview

This plugin enables the consumption of transactions from an AMQP queue provided by a queue system, such as RabbitMQ, widely used in enterprise applications.

The transactions are processed on a first-in first-out (FIFO) order, even when the producer nodeos switches during [auto failover](../producer_ha_plugin/index.md). This feature can make it easier to integrate the blockchain with enterprise applications which use queues widely

It can receive transactions encoded using the `chain::packed_transaction_v0` or `chain::packed_transaction` formats.

## Usage

```console
# config.ini
plugin = eosio::eosio::amqp_trx_plugin
[options]
```
```sh
# command-line
nodeos ... --plugin eosio::eosio::amqp_trx_plugin [options]
```

## Configuration Options

These can be specified from both the `nodeos` command-line or the `config.ini` file:

```console
  --amqp-trx-address arg                AMQP address: Format:
                                        amqp://USER:PASSWORD@ADDRESS:PORT
                                        Will consume from amqp-trx-queue-name

                                        connection is loss or startup.
  --amqp-trx-retry-interval-us arg (=500000)
                                        When connection is lost to
                                        amqp-trx-queue-name, interval time in
                                        microseconds before retrying
                                        connection.
  --amqp-trx-speculative-execution      Allow non-ordered speculative execution
                                        of transactions
  --amqp-trx-ack-mode arg (=in_block)   AMQP ack when 'received' from AMQP,
                                        when 'executed', or when 'in_block' is
                                        produced that contains trx.
                                        Options: received, executed, in_block
  --amqp-trx-startup-stopped            do not start plugin on startup -
