## Overview

This plugin enables streaming messages from the smart contract. The smart contracts can call the `push_event` intrinsic to send a message to an AMQP queue. Any nodeos in a blockchain cluster can be configured to push messages, and a cluster can be configured to have one or more dedicated nodeos instances for streaming.

The streaming support give the ability to contracts to proactively update off-chain services.

The intrinsic `push_event` can send a message if the nodeos executing the transaction is configured to stream, or do nothing if the nodeos is not configured for streaming.

```cpp
inline void push_event(eosio::name tag, std::string route, const std::vector<char>& data)
```

where

* tag: corresponds to individual AQMP queue or exchange.
* route: route for the event.
* data: payload for the event.

## Usage

```console
# config.ini
plugin = eosio::event_streamer_plugin
[options]
```
```sh
# command-line
nodeos ... --plugin eosio::event_streamer_plugin [options]
```

## Configuration Options

These can be specified from both the `nodeos` command-line or the `config.ini` file:

```console
  --event-tag arg                       Event tags for configuration of
                                        environment variables

                                        TAURUS_STREAM_RABBITS_EXCHANGE_<tag>.
                                        The tags correspond to eosio::name tags
                                        in the event_wrapper for mapping to
                                        individual AQMP queue or exchange.
