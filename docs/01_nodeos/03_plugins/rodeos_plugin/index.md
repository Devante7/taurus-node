## Overview

The rodeos_plugin provides a high performance storage engine and interface to run concurrent read-only queries against the blockchain state. The plugin incorporates all the functionality formerly provided by the rodeos binary and obviates the need for running a separate state_history_plugin to source the requisite data.

At startup the plugin resyncs with the latest copy of state from nodeos chainbase. The rodeos_plugin makes use of in-memory transfer of blockchain state from nodeos to the plugin at the end of production or relay of every block. Hence, the plugin itself does not need to maintain a durable copy of the latest state on disk between restarts.

The plugin provides a series of RPC endpoints to query data concurrently, enabling high performance queries of the blockchain state from micro services.

## Usage

```console
# config.ini
plugin =  b1::rodeos_plugin
[options]
```
```sh
# command-line
nodeos ... --plugin  b1::rodeos_plugin  [options]
```

## RPC end points supported

These end points can be used in a manner similar to the equivalent nodeos end points
```
  /v1/chain/get_info
  /v1/chain/get_block
  /v1/chain/get_account
  /v1/chain/get_abi
  /v1/chain/get_raw_abi
  /v1/chain/get_required_keys
  /v1/chain/send_transaction
  /v1/rodeos/create_checkpoint
```

## Configuration Options

These can be specified from the `config.ini` file:

                                        wql-listen. Each retry is approx 1 second
                                        apart. Set to 0 to prevent retries

  wql-contract-dir
                                        Directory to fetch contracts from. These
                                        override contracts on the chain.

  wql-static-dir
                                        Directory to serve static files from
                                        (default: disabled)
  wql-query-mem (33)

  wql-console-size (0)
                                        Maximum size of console data
  wql-wasm-cache-size (100)
                                        Maximum number of compiled wasms to cache

                                        this allows anyone to create a checkpoint
                                        using RPC (default: disabled)
